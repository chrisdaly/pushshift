SMN1 is a gene (section of DNA) which is found on chromosome 5. But each person has two sets of chromosomes (one from the mum and one from the dad) and therefore everyone has two copies of SMN1, yay. SMA is a recessive disorder, which means that *both* copies of SMN1 have to be shitty in order for the person to have SMA. \n\nIn your case OP, only one of your SMN1 genes is a bit shitty. Genes are made up of regions called \"exons\". The exons are important because those are the bits that contain the genetic information that will make the SMN1 protein. In your case, it sounds like your 7th exon region (in just one of your SMN1 genes) is missing. We call that a \"deletion\". But it's OK because your other SMN1 gene has all the exons and so your cells can happily produce the SMN1 protein they need.\n\nThe only thing you need to think about is inheritance. If you were to have a child with somebody else who is a carrier like yourself then each time you had a child you'd have:\n\n- 25% chance of having a child with SMA\n\n- 50% chance of having a child that is a carrier like you\n\n- 25% chance of having a child that isn't a carrier and doesn't have SMA.\n\nIf you were to have children with somebody who isn't a carrier (and who also doesn't have SMA), then you wouldn't be at risk of having a child with SMA but it would still be 50-50 regarding whether your child would be a carrier.\n\nSo this would be a conversation to have with a future partner regarding getting them tested too. It also means that you will likely need to inform your children that they may be carriers so that they can take the same actions (you can also find this out during pregnancy if you wish). Beyond that, you may want to have a conversation with any of your siblings. Chances are that if you are a carrier they might be too, and they may want to have that information for the same reasons you do.", "created_utc": 1515667718, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "dsiieil", "link_id": "t3_7pj0vv", "parent_id": "t3_7pj0vv", "permalink": "/r/spinalmuscularatrophy/comments/7pj0vv/just_found_out_im_a_carrier_of_sma/dsiieil/", "retrieved_on": 1515667719, "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spinalmuscularatrophy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wvsp", "updated_utc": 1515667719}, {"author": "wheeliedave", "author_created_utc": 1413213654, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Or just the mother/s fellow Dave...

I still live with my parents for now but I'm working on changing that. Overall I only need help to prepare meals and use the bathroom but otherwise I'm pretty independent. The thing about SMA is everyone's experience is different. You cant really gauge what his abilities will be based on other's experiences but being active and doing physical therapy can never hurt. \n\nI saw you mention you are an active person. If it means anything, I camp all the time with my parents and was really active in the Boy Scouts when I was younger. I also play [Power Wheelchair Soccer](http://www.powersoccerusa.org) as do alot of people with SMA. There are plenty of things people with SMA can do that lets them be active and outdoors. \n\nI know right now it seems that the world is ending and there is no hope. My parents were the same way when I was diagnosed. This disease however, is not a death sentence. You'll have to adapt to things over time and certain missed experiences will suck but I truly believe someones character is molded by the challenges they face in life. Overall having SMA has played a big part in how I view life and who I am today.

I don't think anyone with SMAII is able to live without any assistance. My parents live thousands of miles away.\n\n- I'm not undergoing Spinraza treatment, it's not currently available where I am and I also have had a spinal fusion which may make the drug hard to deliver so we will see. I have also not decided how I feel about committing to the treatment regime that Spinraza involves. I think it's much easier for a young child so your son is extremely lucky in this sense. He has been born at the best possible time so far, don't lose sight of that.\n\n- For fun I like to see my friends, I'm into board-games, I really enjoy going to the cinema and tv shows, I've joined a choir where I sing badly and I'm also learning how to crochet. \n\n- For work I'm in clinical research as an epidemiologist now but with a background in molecular biology. Originally I wanted to work in a lab and I did for a little while (my carer acted as my assistant) but I ended up hating it and so now I work on patient data instead, monitoring the safety of licensed drugs.\n\nIt sounds like you are indeed quite panicked right now (which is totally and completely normal) but this is not a disease that completely robs you of all quality of life, at least not in my experience. It's frustrating, sometimes it sucks and the emotional toll can be high, I'm not going to lie and say that it doesn't feel damn impossible sometimes, but your son will not know another life. This is the one he has and it's up to you now to work through these feelings, pick yourself up and find strength and resilience. \n\nMy parents have both told me that my diagnosis is what made them grow the fuck up. No parent is perfect (and no child is either!) but I can straight up tell you that whilst my relationship with my parents is complicated and we argue a lot, my bond with them surpasses any bond I've seen between my able-bodied friends and their parents. My parents have moved mountains for me in extremely difficult circumstances. Both came from very poor backgrounds and, despite that, they built me a life where nothing was out of my reach. I would not be where I am without them. Yeah, we never got to ride a bike together and I never got to play football with my dad but nobody knows who I am, what I've been through, what I've overcome and what I'm capable of the way my parents do. \n\nI hope that in a few decades your son might be saying the same thing to a new parent.\n\n", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1501928917, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dl73pxv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6rgdr7", "parent_id": "t1_dl6wd2r", "retrieved_on": 1501928918, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spinalmuscularatrophy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wvsp"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "Preformerr", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "&gt; I know this sucks but you now have the chance to REALLY become a dad.

I live on my own, had a great education, work, have friends and a boyfriend. Life isn't as bleak for us as you may think right now. You're coming into this as someone who has likely had little interaction with disabled people up until now. I promise you that eventually this will all seem more \"normal\", whatever normal means.

You said he seems to be getting weaker by the day. I don't want to give you false hope so take whatever I say with a pinch of salt but a decrease in skills is very common during that age. Abilities will fluctuate in toddlerhood and early childhood because the child is growing and the body has to adapt to an increase in weight as well as lots of other changes. Some of those abilities will come back or you may notice periods of increase in strength. In general, whilst there is a progressive loss of function over time, but that loss should stabilize somewhat so that it becomes less obvious to you that there is a loss in ability on a day-to-day basis. Here is what is important: Do everything you can right now and during childhood to get your child exercise and physio. Swimming is extremely, extremely helpful for exercise but mostly for breathing. You can prolong loss of ability and delay problems if you do a shitload of work now. This is the time when you can do the work. Your 15 year old wont want to go swimming every day. And in adulthood, access to physio becomes harder. Capitalize on this period as much as you can, I can't stress that enough. \n\nI know you feel devastated right now but there are many conditions far worse than type II SMA. I know that's probably hard to imagine. \nTake good care of yourself whilst you work through the grief of the diagnosis, you will come out of the other end.\n\nPS: I got potty-trained just fine but I was a lazy-ass child so I needed to be incentivized with stickers. Less of an SMA problem and more of a personality problem! I demanded stickers every time I peed or pooped up until I was like 8.

In this case, the chance of you having a child with SMA is very very very low. The only way there would be a chance of this happening is if your donor's sperm gets a random mutation in the SMN1 gene - this is very unlikely. I can't put a figure on it but it would be very unlikely and changing sperm donor would not remove that risk.\n\nScenario 2 - You have 1 mutation in 1 of your SMN1 copies (hence you are a carrier) and your sperm donor has a mutation in 1 of his 3 SMN1 copies.

Ok so to understand this, we first need to understand embryonic development. So, let's start with some fundamentals (most of which you probably already know, I'm just laying out the timeline):\n\n1. Man produces sperm with 23 chromosomes, woman produces egg with 23 chromosomes.\n\n2. Sperm and egg fuse to create a single cell (formally known as the zygote) with 46 chromosomes.\n\n3. Approximately 1-2 days after fertilization, the single cell divides into 2 cells, each of which will have 46 chromosomes. A little later into 4 cells, then 8 cells etc. \n\n4. Some time later, this bunch of cells will implant into the woman's uterus and more specialized development begins.\n\nWhat you are talking about is what is known as a *spontaneous mutation* or *de novo mutation*. The mutation is passed down by one parent and the other mutation arises spontaneously in the foetus. For this to occur and cause SMA in the way that you are talking about, the spontaneous mutation would have to occur at step 2 (when the egg and sperm fuse to form a single cell known as a zygote - not yet a foetus). That way, when the zygote divides, **all** the new cells that are formed will also get the mutation. This is theoretically possible but extremely, extremely (really extremely) improbable because you not only have to get a mutation in the right gene, you have to get it in this extremely narrow window of time so that all the cells in the final organism have the mutations.\n\nIf the mutation were to occur later than step 2, it would occur in only one of the many divided cells. This means that the final human would have some totally healthy cells (the ones that did not get the mutation) and some SMA/diseased cells (the ones that were created from the initial mutated cell). This is called a mosaic and as far as I know, there is no evidence to suggest that any people with SMA are mosaics or that being a mosaic would result in the same sort of diseased state that people with SMA present with.\n\nSo if we're talking strictly about mutations in the foetus (after the zygote stage), the answer would be no. If we're talking about mutations that happen at the time of fertilization but before the first divisions of the zygote then the answer is yes but extremely unlikely.\n\nThere is however, another scenario which sort of fits what you're asking and is actually more common than people think. And that's for a spontaneous mutation to occur in just the sperm or the egg, before the two fuse. What I mean is, that one parent would be a normal carrier (i.e. all their cells have 1 shitty SMN1 gene). The other parent is not a carrier but has a sperm or an egg with a spontaneous mutation in the SMN1 gene (i.e. all their cells are normal except for the egg/sperm which has an SMN1 mutation).\n\nNow, for women, all eggs have already been made and are present at her time of birth and she will make no more in her lifetime. She starts off with a couple million eggs and that slowly decreases over time. Men, however, make sperm all the damn time and can release tens of millions of sperm each time they ejaculate. What lovely imagery. Anyway, this means there is a lot more potential for a mutation to arise randomly in a man's sperm than in a woman's egg (although of course the latter is totally possible). So, there are actually people with SMA who have this particular scenario (about 1-2%, so not super rare). One of their parents was a carrier and one of their parents happened to have a sperm or egg with a shitty mutation. When this happens, the most likely scenario is that the woman was the carrier and the man was not a carried but had a sperm with an SMN1 mutation. This scenario is far, far more likely than a mutation when the sperm and egg fuse.\n\nDoes that make sense?", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1518691687, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dua42l8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7pj0vv", "parent_id": "t1_du9gla2", "permalink": "/r/spinalmuscularatrophy/comments/7pj0vv/just_found_out_im_a_carrier_of_sma/dua42l8/", "retrieved_on": 1518691688, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spinalmuscularatrophy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wvsp"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "Colonelwheel", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "Sorry I'm a bit late on this!

SMN1 is a gene (section of DNA) which is found on chromosome 5. But each person has two sets of chromosomes (one from the mum and one from the dad) and therefore everyone has two copies of SMN1, yay. SMA is a recessive disorder, which means that *both* copies of SMN1 have to be shitty in order for the person to have SMA. \n\nIn your case OP, only one of your SMN1 genes is a bit shitty. Genes are made up of regions called \"exons\". The exons are important because those are the bits that contain the genetic information that will make the SMN1 protein. In your case, it sounds like your 7th exon region (in just one of your SMN1 genes) is missing. We call that a \"deletion\". But it's OK because your other SMN1 gene has all the exons and so your cells can happily produce the SMN1 protein they need.\n\nThe only thing you need to think about is inheritance. If you were to have a child with somebody else who is a carrier like yourself then each time you had a child you'd have:\n\n- 25% chance of having a child with SMA\n\n- 50% chance of having a child that is a carrier like you\n\n- 25% chance of having a child that isn't a carrier and doesn't have SMA.\n\nIf you were to have children with somebody who isn't a carrier (and who also doesn't have SMA), then you wouldn't be at risk of having a child with SMA but it would still be 50-50 regarding whether your child would be a carrier.\n\nSo this would be a conversation to have with a future partner regarding getting them tested too. It also means that you will likely need to inform your children that they may be carriers so that they can take the same actions (you can also find this out during pregnancy if you wish).

These are all so obvious to me now but they weren't obvious in my teens or early adulthood so I made lots of mistakes. Probably obvious to you too as an adult but will list them anyway:\n\n- The need for flexible working hours so that you can deal with medical issues that become more frequent as you get older (and it's not just the medical issues, once you become an adult there's generally a lot of other stuff you have to sort out that might require occasional time off).\n\n- The need to work from home always or sometimes. If not possible to work from home then the work should be somewhere where we can just be left to it (i.e. not something that requires lots of moving around between buildings or across the city during the day, not something that requires travel etc).\n\n- The need for a job where the mind is more important than the body. That sounds like it's really obvious but I was surprised by how many jobs that seem \"mind-oriented\" actually had a lot of hidden physical demands.\n\n- A job that requires only the use of hands, nothing more strenuous than that.\n\n- Preferably a job that pays OK because let's be honest, being disabled is bloody expensive.\n\nNow for career options.\n\nFor the person that likes people and is good at feelings: I've kind of thought for a while that a really good job for someone with SMA is to be a therapist/counsellor of some sort. If you go into private practice you can work from a room in your home (you can make it your office), the pay is good and you'll be fine doing it for a very long time because you just need to listen and talk (and take notes I guess, but you can do that in your own time at your own pace). I don't think it's possible to go into private practice straight away (or maybe it is) so there would be a few years of training in which you might not be working out of your home but at a young age that might be manageable. Also, if you are working privately you don't need to worry about discrimination when trying to get hired by a company or whatever - you're in control. You might have a few clients who don't want a disabled therapist but I doubt that's a major issue. Honestly, if I could go back, this is what I would do.\n\nFor the science person: Computer science. It pays well and in the right fields you can likely work remotely, from home - likely able to set your own hours. It will require a lot of education to get to a good level but it's one of those fields for which there is always work. Maths and physics are important aspects so if that is something that your kid hates then it's still possible to try to look for a career that's heavily computer-based but not so reliant on those kinds of subjects. Something like data management could work, for example.\n\nFor the computer person who is more creative: Editing or design. An acquaintance of mine is a video editor at a news corp, he seems to be doing just fine so something like that could work. Probably a bit harder to get a good job from home but maybe not impossible - especially if you do well in your early years.\n\nThose are my thoughts for now anyway!", "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1512315129, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dqpc0fp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7h9jo2", "parent_id": "t3_7h9jo2", "permalink": "/r/spinalmuscularatrophy/comments/7h9jo2/what_doesdid_everyone_do_for_work/dqpc0fp/", "retrieved_on": 1512315130, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spinalmuscularatrophy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wvsp"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "jdnorth", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "body": "I\u2019m 18 with type 3 and just had my first maintenance injection, 5th injection overall.
